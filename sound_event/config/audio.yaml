# Audio input configuration

# Device name or substring used by sounddevice.
# For ReSpeaker Mic Array v3.0, this often contains "ReSpeaker".
device: "hw:0,0"

# Sample rate in Hz. We standardize on 16 kHz for this project.
sample_rate: 16000

# Number of samples per audio callback block.
# At 16 kHz, 512 samples ≈ 32 ms.
block_size: 512

# Number of output channels for DOA pipeline (after channel mapping).
# For ReSpeaker: 4 (CH1-CH4 are the raw mic channels).
channels: 4

# Channel mapping for ReSpeaker 6-channel firmware.
# ReSpeaker provides 6 channels:
#   CH0 = processed audio (NOT used)
#   CH1 = mic1 raw  <-- use this
#   CH2 = mic2 raw  <-- use this
#   CH3 = mic3 raw  <-- use this
#   CH4 = mic4 raw  <-- use this
#   CH5 = merged playback (NOT used)
# 
# This mapping selects CH1-CH4 (indices 1,2,3,4) from the 6-channel stream.
# Set to null/empty to disable mapping (directly use first 'channels' channels).
channel_mapping: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Number of channels to capture from device (only needed if channel_mapping is used).
# For ReSpeaker 6-channel firmware, this should be 6.
# If not specified and channel_mapping is provided, will be inferred as max(channel_mapping) + 1.
capture_channels: 6

# Numpy dtype used internally.
dtype: float32

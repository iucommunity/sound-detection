# MCRA (Minima-Controlled Recursive Averaging) noise estimation config.
# Used to estimate stationary noise power |N(k, t)|^2 frame by frame.

# Smoothing factor for spectral power tracking
# Typical range: 0.7–0.98. Lower = faster adaptation.
alpha_s: 0.85

# Number of frames in minima-tracking window.
# At 10 ms hop size, 15 frames ≈ 150 ms.
minima_window: 15

# Detection threshold factor.
# Noise minima multiplied by this factor.
delta: 1.5

# Decision smoothing for speech presence probability.
alpha_d: 0.1

# Small epsilon to avoid division-by-zero in normalization.
epsilon: 1e-8
